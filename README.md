# evio Software Package 5.2

This is a snapshot of the evio 5.2 release as published at
https://coda.jlab.org/

It is reproduced with permission in this git repository for the purposes
as a build dependence (via submodule) for the Hall A and C analyzers.

The upstream DAQ Group evio repository is private, but can be found here:
  https://github.com/JeffersonLab/evio

At some point we plan to replaces this ancilliary repo with a pointer to a
tagged release off the DAQ group's repo.
